# BalancedBrackets
BRAVI Test

Hello!
First of all, we’d like to thank you for your interest in Bravi. We hope this email finds you well.
As the next step in the recruitment process we want to do a quick exercise with you.
The assessment has three assignments. You should push your code to GitHub (or another
git service). The assignments 2 and 3 should be published to any cloud service.
We expect to see how you test your application, if you follow good practices and how you
solve problems. Please solve the following challenges using .NET and React and ask any
question if you need.
1. Balanced Brackets
Write a function that takes a string of brackets as the input, and determines if the order of the
brackets is valid. A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ),
{, }, [, or ].
We say a sequence of brackets is valid if the following conditions are met:
● It contains no unmatched brackets.
● The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is
also a matched pair of brackets.
Examples:
● (){}[] is valid
● [{()}](){} is valid
● []{() is not valid
● [{)] is not valid
